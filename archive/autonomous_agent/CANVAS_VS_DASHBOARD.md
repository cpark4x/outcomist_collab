## 🎨 Canvas UI

### When to Use
- You're working on **multiple tasks simultaneously**
- You want to **visually organize** your workspace
- You're a **visual thinker** who thinks spatially
- You want to **monitor multiple tasks** at once
- You're creating a **workflow pipeline**
- You want to **compare results side-by-side**

### Key Features
✅ **Infinite 2D space** - Arrange tasks anywhere
✅ **Drag and drop** - Physical organization
✅ **Real-time cards** - See all tasks updating live
✅ **Spatial memory** - "That task is over there"
✅ **Visual relationships** - Group related tasks
✅ **Parallel monitoring** - Watch everything at once

### User Experience
```

Mental model: "My workspace"
Interaction: Spatial, tactile, visual
```

### Example Workflows
**Multi-stage pipeline**:
```
Research → Analysis → Report
(all visible, organized left to right)
```

**A/B comparison**:
```
Approach A
    vs
Approach B
(side by side)
```

**Project organization**:
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Project X     │
├─────────────────┤
│ Task 1  Task 2  │
│ Task 3  Task 4  │
└─────────────────┘

┌─────────────────┐
│   Project Y     │
├─────────────────┤
│ Task 5  Task 6  │
└─────────────────┘
```
